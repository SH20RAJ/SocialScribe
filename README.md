# SocialScribe ✍️

**SocialScribe** is an AI-powered tool that helps you create tailored social media posts, comments, and direct messages (DMs) for platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and more. You can easily write content by providing a context and selecting options such as tone, formality, and even whether you want it to be playful or professional! 😎
